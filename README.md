Design Patterns in Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming

## Design Patterns

1. Observer
2. Strategy
3. Template Method

### Observer

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about
any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

### Strategy

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate
class, and make their objects interchangeable.

### Template Method

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets
subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
